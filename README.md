Hi! I'm passionate about learning and building useful things with data and code.
I have a degree in Software engineering and I’m currently studying intelligent computer system engineering and working on projects related to data mining, data warehousing, and software development.
Here you'll find a mix of academic projects and personal experiments, all part of my journey to grow as a developer and problem-solver.
I'm always open to collaboration and learning new technologies!
